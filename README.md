`jx-registry` is a simple command line tool for working with container registries.

The main use case is initially to support lazy creation of AWS ECR registries on demand. Most other registries allow a registry to be created and used for different images.


## Getting Started

Download the [jx-registry binary](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-registry/releases) for your operating system and add it to your `$PATH`.

## Commands

See the [jx-registry command reference](https://github.com/jenkins-x-plugins/jx-registry/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-registry.md#jx-registry)
